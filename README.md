# D.air

D.air is a volunteer-run collection of open-source projects focused on building software that helps people.

This organization exists to make it easier for contributors to find meaningful projects and for maintainers to find collaborators. That’s it.

Some people here are experienced engineers. Others are still learning. Both are welcome.

## What you’ll find here

This GitHub organization hosts projects submitted by the D.air community. Projects vary in scope and maturity, but they all share a few things:

* They’re open source
* They’re non-commercial
* They’re intended to be useful to real people or communities

Projects may involve coding, documentation, design, research, or general maintenance. Not every contribution has to be technical.

---

## How things work

* Maintainers submit projects to D.air
* Contributors browse projects and request to join
* Maintainers decide who to accept based on their project’s needs
* Work happens in the open, on GitHub

Each project is run by its maintainers. Expectations, contribution style, and pace can differ from project to project.

## Contributing

If you’re interested in contributing:

1. Browse projects on **[https://dair.dev](https://dair.dev)**
2. Read the project’s onboarding or “Start Here” section
3. Request to join if it looks like a good fit

It’s okay to start small. Documentation, testing, and feedback are all valuable.

## Conduct

We expect people here to be respectful and act in good faith.

Harassment, discrimination, and abusive behavior aren’t acceptable. If there’s an issue, report it rather than escalating it publicly.
